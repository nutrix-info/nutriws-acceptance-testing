Narrative:
In order to develop an application that requires a stack efficiently
As a development team
I would like to use an interface and implementation in Java directly

Scenario: 3 squared
Given a variable x with value <x_value>
When I multiply x by <y_time>
Then x should equal <result>

Examples:
|x_value|y_time|result|
|100    |2     |200   |
|101    |3     |303   |
